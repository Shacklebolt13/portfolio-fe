        "## Summary\n---",
        "This is a blog post about my experience pentesting a captive portal at my college. I wanted to access the internet without any restrictions, so I decided to pentest the captive portal. I wrote a simple Python script to brute force the passwords of hundreds of students in a few minutes. I informed the college authorities about the vulnerability, and they were very grateful. This experience taught me a lot about cybersecurity and how important it is to report vulnerabilities to the right people.",
        "## Scenario\n---",
        "I was studying in my first year at GIET, University. \nIt was a secluded place with no internet connectivity. \nThe only way to access the internet was through the college's captive portal. \nThe captive portal was a web page that required the user to log in with their \ncredentials to access the internet. \nThe captive portal was a simple web page with a username and password field. ",
        "The username was the student's roll number, and the password was a random set of 4 digit.\nThe password was generated by the college's server and was unique for each student.\nThe students were free to change their password anytime they wanted, however, since this \nhad to be done through the college's server room, many students didn't bother to change it.",
        "## My motivation behind the pentest\n---",
        "The provided data was 1GB per day, which would often get exhausted by the evening.\nIt was not enough for students like me who wanted to learn more, watch tutorials, and\ndo research. I wanted to access the internet without any restrictions.",
        "I had a few great professors who would often share their passwords with me, but I didn't want to rely on them.\nAs they often had their own work to do and I didn't want to bother them, also they shared their password with many students, and having \nonly one session at a time, I would often get disconnected.",
        "## Pentesting the captive portal\n---",
        "I started by analyzing the captive portal's web page. I saw that the web page was\na simple HTML form with a username and password field. The form was submitted to the\nserver using the POST method. ",
        "I had never written a web application or script before, so I started learning about how I could\nautomate the login process. I learned about Python and how I could use the requests library to\nsend HTTP requests to the server.",
        "Since I had always been interested in learning cybersecurity, I understood that the password was \nsmall enough to brute force, but I did not know how to write a script to do that. I had always been a \nscript kiddie, using existing tools to hack into systems. I tried a few tools, like Hydra, but I couldn't customize them to work with the captive portal.",
        "Finally, I decided to write my own script. I started by writing a simple Python script that would send a POST request to the server with the username and password.\nI used the requests library to send the request and then simply parsed the  response to check if the login was successful.\nThere was a specific error message that was displayed when the login was unsuccessful, so I used that to check if the login was successful or not.\nThe script was very simple, it would simply accept a roll number and would try all possible 4 digit passwords.",
        "## Conclusion\n---",
        "I ran the script and it worked! I was able to easily brute force passwords of hundreds of students in a few minutes.\nI showed this to my professor, and he was impressed. He told me that I had a bright future in cybersecurity and that I should continue learning.",
        "I informed the college authorities about the vulnerability in their captive portal. \nThey were very grateful and thanked me for bringing this to their attention."
