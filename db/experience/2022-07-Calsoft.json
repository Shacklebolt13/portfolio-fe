        "## What I learned ?  \\n---  \\nAs training was a part of this internship, I learned a lot during the internship. I was trained on both soft skills as well as the technical skills required for a corporate career. The soft skill trainings ranged from behavioral, to procedural, provided by many learned colleagues and Alumni. It gave me a chance to take a look at the internal workings of a corporate body, communicating with management at various levels.\tI was also provided technical trainings, ranging from proprietary software and frameworks, like VMWare's vRealize Solution, to Open-Source software and frameworks, like Sprint Boot, Angular.   \\n\\nApart from trainings, I learned a lot by working on the client projects. I learned a lot about the different services provided by AWS, and how to use them for architecting an application. I learned how to efficiently collaborate with larger teams, and on projects of larger scale following Agile. How to uphold coding quality and standards, along with how to make the code efficient and easy to debug.  "
